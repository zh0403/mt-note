# 📕 MT Note: Decentralized Bookkeeping for Mantle

**MT Note** is a privacy-first browser extension that allows users to attach encrypted, permanent notes to any transaction on the Mantle Network.

## 🚀 The Problem
Blockchain transactions are cryptic. Months after a transaction, users forget why they sent 500 MNT to `0x7a...9b`. Existing solutions are centralized (data loss risk) or public (privacy risk).

## 💡 The Solution
MT Note injects a "Bookkeeping Layer" directly into the block explorer.
* **Write:** Add notes to any tx on MantleScan.
* **Encrypt:** Notes are AES-encrypted with your wallet signature (Client-Side).
* **Store:** Encrypted data is stored on-chain (Mantle Sepolia).
* **Manage:** A dedicated Dashboard to view, search, and export your financial history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML/JS, Chrome Extension Manifest V3
* **Blockchain:** Mantle Sepolia Testnet
* **Smart Contract:** Solidity (Ownable, Monetizable)
* **Libraries:** Ethers.js, Crypto-JS

## 💰 Business Model
1.  **Micro-Fees:** Protocol charges a small fee (e.g., 0.05 MNT) per note (Currently 0 for Hackathon).
2.  **Freemium Dashboard:** Advanced analytics and CSV export for "Pro" users.
